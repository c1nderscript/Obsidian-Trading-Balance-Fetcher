# 2025-08-09 Linting and CI

## Decision
Adopt ruff and black via pre-commit with a CI workflow to run linters and tests.

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Consistency and automated quality checks are required.

## Consequences
Developers run `pre-commit run --all-files` and `pytest`; CI executes the same on pushes and pull requests.
